pydicom release checklist
* write ReleaseNotes by going through revision history - best seen at Project Home | Updates
* review issue list for any other changes that should be in the release
* edit __init__.py version number
* edit setup.py -- version number, description, license if necessary, etc
* remove extra debug statements (e.g. in data_element_generator) and extra print statements
* run test/performance/time_test.py to check performance hasn't degraded
* run test/all.bat on windows to test with all supported python versions
* run test/all.sh on linux/mac to test all supported python versions
* run each example file and clean up any output files created
* make sure all changes have been committed to repository
* loop back to running all tests if any changes to main code made
* check back out to a clean directory -- that way sure to not include extra files in the build
* build the package files
    * on windows, python setup.py bdist_wininst --> get windows installer exe in dist directory
    * on linux, python setup.py sdist  --> get .tar.gz source file (also used by easy_install) in dist directory
* use the dist files to install the package on
  * windows -- 32-bit  / 64-bit using Windows installer
  * linux   -- 32-bit  / 64-bit
  and run the tests in at least one python version on each system
* upload dist files to googlecode site
* run easy_install (retrieve from pypi) again on clean system and make sure it works:
* verify that source install has _all_ directories and subdirectories included
* update documentation:
  * update Release Notes page
  * special attention to deprecated modules, classes, etc
  * look for references to specific versions
  * any changes related to version of python itself
  * read all pages quickly
* update News page with quick synopsis of major features
* announce on pydicom google group
* tag the release -- with TortoiseSvn use Copy (Branch / Tag), 
           to URL https://pydicom.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-X.X.X,
           with Create copy from HEAD, if no changes made since built, else use revision number,
           and message "Tag version X.X.X release."
* update info on medphysfiles.com
* register with pypi -- python setup.py register
* others -- freshmeat? idoimaging.com? macports?
