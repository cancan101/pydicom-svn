pydicom release checklist
* write ReleaseNotes by going through revision history - best seen at Project Home | Updates
* review issue list for any other changes that should be in the release
* run test/all.bat on windows to test all python versions against svn code
* run test/all.sh on linux/mac to test all python versions against svn code
* run each example file and clean up any output files created
* make sure all changes have been committed to repository
* build the package files
    * python setup.py bdist_wininst
    * python setup.py sdist
* install the package on
  * windows -- 32-bit  / 64-bit using Windows installer
  * linux   -- 32-bit  / 64-bit
  and run the tests in one python version on each system
* register with pypi -- python setup.py register
* run easy_install (retrieve from pypi) again on clean system and make sure it works:
  * with -e option to install source?
  * as a pure egg
* verify that source install has _all_ directories and subdirectories included
* update documentation:
  * update Release Notes page
  * special attention to deprecated modules, classes, etc
  * look for references to specific versions and update
  * any changes related to version of python itself
  * read all pages quickly
